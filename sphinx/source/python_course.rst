Python for Environmental Scientists
=====================================


The Environmental Scientist’s Introduction to Python
------------------------------------------------------

`The Environmental Scientist’s Introduction to Python <https://basic-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
is an open source training course to give environmental scientists the foundation they need to begin learning and using
the scientific tools that have been developed for python. The course focuses on simplifying python language into two
buckets: **the must haves** and **the nice to haves**. The course if far from comprehensive, but we believe that it's
better for people to get cracking, and fill in the gaps as they develop their skills.

    **Expected course duration: 1-2 days**
