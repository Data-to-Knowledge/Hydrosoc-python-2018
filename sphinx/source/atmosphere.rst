ETo
------------
The `ETo <https://github.com/mullenkamp/ETo>`_  project was created to develop programming tools to calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the `UN-FAO 56 paper <http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/X0490E00.htm>`_ [1]. Additional functions have been added to calculate historic ETo or potential evapotranspiration (PET) for comparison purposes. Currently developed for Python.
