Python Hydrosoc workshop 2018
==============================

The general goal of the course is to get people more familiar with Python tools specifically beneficial for natural/environmental scientists in New Zealand. This will be accomplished through a combination of practical exercises and presentations.

All course materials are accessible via the `course website <http://hydrosoc-python-2018.rtfd.io/>`_.

Intended audience
------------------
The intended audience for the course are people with very little to some experience with programming (Python or otherwise). Those people with a lot of Python programming experience will not likely get much out of the course unless they have not used the Pandas package in the past.

Prerequisites
-------------
The main prerequisite for the course is the `Intro to Python for Environmental Scientists <https://basic-python.readthedocs.io>`_. First, `install python <https://basic-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_python.html#our-recommended-python-installation-for-further-work>`_. Then please become familiar with the sections starting with `Basic Python Objects, Variables, and Operators <https://basic-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_objects.html>`_.

Course summary
--------------
The course will cover the fundamental handling of tabular data and the associated processing and analysis tools. We will be primarily using the toolset contained within the `Pandas package <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>`_. This will include reading/writing data, indexing, reshaping, computations, joining tables, time series handling, and visualization.
